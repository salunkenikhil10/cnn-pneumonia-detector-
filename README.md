# 🩺 Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-ray Images

This project is a deep learning-based solution that detects **Pneumonia** from chest X-ray images using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. It helps automate the diagnosis process by classifying X-ray images as either **Pneumonia** or **Normal**.
