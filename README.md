🩺 Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-rays
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify chest X-ray images as Pneumonia or Normal. It helps automate the early detection of pneumonia using deep learning techniques.

🔍 Key Features
Binary classification using CNN

Trained on sample X-ray dataset

Accurate predictions with visual feedback

Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

Simple interface for testing predictions

📈 Future Improvements
Use Transfer Learning with pretrained models (e.g., ResNet, VGG)

Add Grad-CAM for model interpretability

Build a user-friendly web interface (Flask or Streamlit)

Enhance model robustness with data augmentation
